# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation Hub. This collection of process documents provides a comprehensive guide to how OctoAcme manages and delivers projects.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, clear ownership, and continuous improvement. Our processes are designed to support cross-functional teams in delivering high-quality products efficiently while maintaining transparency and alignment across all stakeholders.

### Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to enable rapid feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has designated Project Manager and Product Lead roles
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

## Key Documentation

### Getting Started

- **[Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)** - Start here for a concise introduction to OctoAcme's project management approach, core principles, roles, and key artifacts. Essential reading for all new team members.

- **[Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)** - Detailed definitions of the key roles in OctoAcme projects, including Developers, Product Managers, and Project Managers, with responsibilities, goals, and communication patterns for each.

### Project Lifecycle

Our project lifecycle consists of five key phases, each with specific processes and deliverables:

#### 1. Initiation
- **[Project Initiation Guide](octoacme-project-initiation.md)** - Learn how to validate and authorize new work, align stakeholders, and create a project one-pager with clear success metrics and timeline.

#### 2. Planning
- **[Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)** - Turn approved initiatives into actionable plans, create prioritized backlogs, estimate scope, and establish release timelines.

#### 3. Execution
- **[Execution and Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)** - Guidance for day-to-day execution, team workflows, PR processes, quality assurance, and progress tracking.

#### 4. Release
- **[Release and Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)** - Standardized release processes, pre-release requirements, deployment checklists, and rollback procedures.

#### 5. Retrospective
- **[Retrospective and Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)** - Capture learnings, convert them into actionable improvements, and foster a culture of continuous enhancement.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **[Risk Management and Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)** - How to identify, assess, and mitigate risks, plus stakeholder communication templates and escalation paths.

## Process Summary

### Key Workflows

OctoAcme's project workflows are organized around the following practices:

- **Initiation**: Every project starts with a one-pager that defines the problem, objectives, success metrics, and stakeholders
- **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria and Definition of Done
- **Daily Execution**: Use project boards (GitHub Projects), daily standups, and weekly syncs to maintain momentum
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing (unit, integration, E2E), security scanning, and manual QA as needed
- **Release Management**: Structured deployment with staging validation, smoke tests, and rollback plans
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular retrospectives to identify and implement process improvements

### Personas and Roles

Three primary roles collaborate to deliver projects:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, manages schedules and risks, facilitates communication
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, write tests, collaborate on design, estimate work
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and feedback

### Communication Strategies

Clear, consistent communication is essential to project success:

- **Team Level**: Daily 15-minute standups, weekly delivery syncs, sprint demos
- **Leadership Level**: Weekly PM + PdM alignment, monthly stakeholder updates
- **Documentation**: Project boards, risk registers, status updates, retrospective notes
- **Escalation**: Three-tier escalation path (Team → PM/Product Lead → Sponsor)
- **Transparency**: Single source of truth for project status (README or release docs)

### Quality Assurance Practices

Quality is built into every phase:

- **Development**: Unit tests for new logic, integration tests where applicable
- **Pre-Release**: End-to-end smoke tests, security scanning in CI
- **Code Review**: Small PRs (<= 400 lines), automated tests, minimum one approval
- **Deployment**: Staging validation, post-deploy verifications, rollback plans
- **Monitoring**: Track velocity, burndown, success metrics, error rates, and usage
- **Continuous Improvement**: Blameless retrospectives, action item tracking

## Key Artifacts

Throughout the project lifecycle, teams create and maintain:

- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective Notes and Action Items
- Release Notes
- Status Reports

## Communication Cadence

- **Daily**: Standups (15 minutes)
- **Twice Weekly**: Team delivery syncs (or as agreed)
- **Weekly**: PM + PdM alignment, risk register updates
- **Monthly**: Stakeholder updates
- **Per Sprint/Milestone**: Demos, retrospectives
- **Ad-hoc**: Escalations and incident response as needed

## Continuous Improvement

OctoAcme's processes are living documents. We encourage teams to:

- Capture learnings in retrospectives
